# dotfiles

After reading about GNU command `stow`, and [Wesley's article on stow and dotfiles](https://medium.com/@waterkip/managing-my-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow-262d2540a866), I needed a more flexible setup that could handle different distributions. 

## Installation

1. Install `stow` with `./install-stow.sh` or with your package manager
2. Link the modules to your home folder with the command `./setup-env`

## Goals

- Create a separate folder for dealing with private local configuration
